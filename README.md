# Enough! Just show me.
A nice malinke rhythm for circumcision, slow Soli, for djembe could look like this in TUBS:

```
Signal:   |O| |o|o| |o| |o|o| |x|x|x| | | |

Djembe 1: |B| |o|o| | |x|o|o| |B|x| | |x| |

Djembe 2: |x| | |x|x| |o|o|x| |B|x|x| |o|o|

o = tone, x = slap, B = bass, O = flam with two tones
```
